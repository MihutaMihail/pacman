► GAME CHOSEN  
The game that I chose was "PAC-MAN"

► How to launch game  
Since this is a browser game, it can be launched using any tool that can start a server. I used an extension called "Live Server" 
using visual studio code

► 60 hz vs 144 hz  
Every time that I tried to limit the game to 60 fps, it always had some sort of problem so I gave up on it. Of course this means that
on a higher refresh rate monitor, the game will run faster (more frames). 
MOVEMENT → in terms on movement, holding the key (ie right arrow key) seems to be better on lower fps while on higher fps, tapping
at the right moment seems to be better.

(I didn't want to just copy the code from the video so I wrote a few comments + made a 'help.txt' that describes how)
(a few functions / lines of codes work to understand a little better)

(I ended up not using this but it was still nice to see a different way of doing things)

→ ChatGPT  
It was used to ask questions for better understanding of what I'm doing (questions about certains functions), adding music/sounds, 
resolving some bugs, css, etc.
