## Introduction
As the name implies, this is a Pac-man game. However, I didn't try to replicate it 1:1, so there are some things that I didn't add. My version of Pacman consists of two levels at the moment. Each level has one or two power ups (which is shown as the larger white circle) that when taken, the ghosts will become scared and this is where you can eat them for extra points. The point of the game is to pass the first and second level while eating all the pellets. Once you beat the game, or die, you will be prompted a screen to enter your name. There is an extra section in the main menu, where you can check your high scores.

## Installation
Since this is a browser game, you will need some sort of web server for the game to run on. Personally, I used the extension "Live Server" provided by Visual Studio Code. Once installed, you can press on the button "Go Live" in the bottom right of the screen.

## About
• The game is capped to 60 fps. Having monitors with 120Hz, 144Hz or anything lower / higher, would not increase the speed of the game.

• The game is not optimised for different size screens. If your screen is too small, you will probably have some display problems. For reference, the high score text was originally below the amount of lives but was moved because of this problem.

This tutorial is a big part of the project. However, to show that I didn't just copy the code, on top of already adding new things to it, I made a **help.txt** file where I wrote some lines of codes / functions that I really didn't understand to show that.

• Github on how to set up tiles + move character + collisions  
https://github.com/mozdevs/gamedev-js-tiles <br>
I ended up not using any of this, but it was still usefull to see.

• ChatGPT  
It was used to ask questions for better understanding of what I'm doing (questions about certains functions), adding music/sounds, 
resolving some bugs, css, etc.
